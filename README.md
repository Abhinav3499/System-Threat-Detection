# System Threat Detection

A machine learning project for predicting system malware infection probability based on telemetry data collected from antivirus software.

## üìã Project Overview

This project implements a binary classification system to predict whether a computer system is likely to be infected by malware based on various system properties and telemetry data. The model analyzes features such as antivirus configurations, system specifications, geographic location, and security settings to assess infection risk.

## üéØ Problem Statement

The goal is to predict a system's probability of getting infected by various families of malware, based on different properties of that system. The telemetry data containing these properties and the system infections was generated by threat reports collected by system's antivirus software.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset contains 100,000 training samples with 76 features including:

### System Information
- **MachineID**: Unique identifier for each system
- **ProductName**: Antivirus product name (win8defender, mse)
- **EngineVersion**: Antivirus engine version
- **AppVersion**: Application version
- **SignatureVersion**: Virus signature version

### Security Features
- **RealTimeProtectionState**: Real-time protection status
- **IsPassiveModeEnabled**: Passive mode configuration
- **NumAntivirusProductsInstalled**: Number of installed antivirus products
- **NumAntivirusProductsEnabled**: Number of enabled antivirus products
- **HasTpm**: Trusted Platform Module presence
- **FirewallEnabled**: Firewall status
- **IsSecureBootEnabled**: Secure boot status

### System Specifications
- **PlatformType**: Operating system platform
- **Processor**: CPU information
- **OSVersion**: Operating system version
- **OSBuildNumber**: OS build number
- **TotalPhysicalRAMMB**: Total RAM capacity
- **PrimaryDiskCapacityMB**: Primary disk capacity
- **ProcessorCoreCount**: Number of CPU cores

### Geographic & Regional Data
- **CountryID**: Country identifier
- **CityID**: City identifier
- **GeoRegionID**: Geographic region
- **LocaleEnglishNameID**: Language locale

### Target Variable
- **target**: Binary classification (0 = not infected, 1 = infected)

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Data Preprocessing
- Removed columns with single unique values (non-informative features)
- Handled missing values through imputation
- Applied feature scaling for numerical variables
- Encoded categorical variables

### Feature Engineering
- Identified highly correlated features for potential removal
- Applied dimensionality reduction techniques
- Used feature selection methods (RFE, PCA, SFS)

### Models Implemented
1. **Baseline Models**
   - Dummy Classifier (most frequent strategy)
   - Logistic Regression
   - Naive Bayes

2. **Ensemble Methods**
   - Random Forest Classifier
   - Bagging Classifier with Random Forest
   - AdaBoost with Random Forest
   - Gradient Boosting Classifier

3. **Other Algorithms**
   - K-Nearest Neighbors
   - Support Vector Machine
   - Decision Trees

### Model Performance
The best performing model achieved:
- **Training Accuracy**: ~100% (indicating overfitting)
- **Validation Accuracy**: ~61.6%
- **Test Accuracy**: ~61.5%

## üìà Key Findings

1. **Feature Importance**: System security configurations and antivirus settings are crucial predictors
2. **Overfitting**: Models show high training accuracy but lower validation accuracy
3. **Class Balance**: Dataset is relatively balanced between infected and non-infected systems
4. **Correlation Analysis**: Several features show high correlation, suggesting redundancy

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python 3.10**
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development environment
